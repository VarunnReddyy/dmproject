    **The Nature of the Topic**  
    The primary causes of sea level rise associated with climate change are the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of ice from glaciers and polar regions. Coastal erosion, seawater intrusion, habitat loss, and community displacement are some of its effects. It may result in major harm to infrastructure and higher adoption costs from an economic perspective.

    In order to analyze trends and forecast the future, data analysis techniques like linear regression are used to inform efficient planning and policy.  
    **The major goal is to analyze the trend in sea level rise and make future predictions using linear regression.**

    **It considers several key aspects**:
    - **A. Data-Driven Analysis**: Focuses on the usage of quantitative methods to investigate sea data and recognize tendencies over time.
    - **B. Employs statistical techniques like linear regression**, a statistical technique to identify relationships among variables.
    - **C. It basically addresses the consequence of climate change**, which indirectly helps to quantify the rise in sea levels.
    - **D. This project aims to not only analyze the historical data but also make predictions about the future sea level scenarios**.
    - **E. This idea combines elements of statistics, geography, environmental sciences, and social sciences**, making it a multidisciplinary topic.

    **Why it is important**:  
    The Analysis of Sea Level Rise is significant because it directly addresses the ongoing global challenge of climate change, particularly highlighting the increasing rates of sea level rise. Sea levels have been steadily rising due to melting polar ice caps and glaciers, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater caused by global warming.  
    **It has been observed that the global sea levels are rising as a result of human-caused global warming, with recent rates being unprecedented over the past 2,000-plus years.** This phenomenon needs high attention as it threatens coastal ecosystems, human settlements, and economic stability, as more than 40% of the global population lives within 100 kilometers of coastlines.

    **By analyzing historical sea level data**, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of past trends and offer predictive insights for future sea level rise.  
    This project is critical for governments, climate researchers, and policymakers to make informed strategies for mitigating risks associated with flooding, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. **These events can lead to the displacement of communities, loss of biodiversity, and substantial financial costs to coastal infrastructure.**

    This project's data-driven approach will highlight the urgency of adopting climate resilience measures. **The insights generated will aid in designing flood defenses, creating sustainable cities, and advocating for reduced greenhouse gas emissions.** The ability to predict sea level rise trajectories is crucial for international negotiations on climate change policies, helping to quantify risks to vulnerable regions.

    **To conclude**, this project will not only make scientific contributions but also foster societal preparedness and resilience in addressing one of the most pressing environmental issues of the century.

    **What has been done so far and what gaps remain**:  
    - Researched different types of attributes needed for developing data models.
    - Explored various datasets to understand the structure, including year and rise in sea level.
    - Collected datasets and are working on curating them for further analysis.
    - **Major challenge**: Collecting datasets for different locations.

    **Who are affected**:
    - **People residing in low-lying coastal regions** face displacement and loss of property.
    - **Tourism, real estate, and fishing industries** may be affected by flooding and erosion, leading to significant losses.
    - **Cities with buildings, utilities, and roads along the shore** are at risk of flooding.
