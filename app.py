# #     **The Nature of the Topic**  
# #     The primary causes of sea level rise associated with climate change are the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of ice from glaciers and polar regions. Coastal erosion, seawater intrusion, habitat loss, and community displacement are some of its effects. It may result in major harm to infrastructure and higher adoption costs from an economic perspective.

# #     In order to analyze trends and forecast the future, data analysis techniques like linear regression are used to inform efficient planning and policy.  
# #     **The major goal is to analyze the trend in sea level rise and make future predictions using linear regression.**

# #     **It considers several key aspects**:
# #     - **A. Data-Driven Analysis**: Focuses on the usage of quantitative methods to investigate sea data and recognize tendencies over time.
# #     - **B. Employs statistical techniques like linear regression**, a statistical technique to identify relationships among variables.
# #     - **C. It basically addresses the consequence of climate change**, which indirectly helps to quantify the rise in sea levels.
# #     - **D. This project aims to not only analyze the historical data but also make predictions about the future sea level scenarios**.
# #     - **E. This idea combines elements of statistics, geography, environmental sciences, and social sciences**, making it a multidisciplinary topic.

# #     **Why it is important**:  
# #     The Analysis of Sea Level Rise is significant because it directly addresses the ongoing global challenge of climate change, particularly highlighting the increasing rates of sea level rise. Sea levels have been steadily rising due to melting polar ice caps and glaciers, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater caused by global warming.  
# #     **It has been observed that the global sea levels are rising as a result of human-caused global warming, with recent rates being unprecedented over the past 2,000-plus years.** This phenomenon needs high attention as it threatens coastal ecosystems, human settlements, and economic stability, as more than 40% of the global population lives within 100 kilometers of coastlines.

# #     **By analyzing historical sea level data**, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of past trends and offer predictive insights for future sea level rise.  
# #     This project is critical for governments, climate researchers, and policymakers to make informed strategies for mitigating risks associated with flooding, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. **These events can lead to the displacement of communities, loss of biodiversity, and substantial financial costs to coastal infrastructure.**

# #     This project's data-driven approach will highlight the urgency of adopting climate resilience measures. **The insights generated will aid in designing flood defenses, creating sustainable cities, and advocating for reduced greenhouse gas emissions.** The ability to predict sea level rise trajectories is crucial for international negotiations on climate change policies, helping to quantify risks to vulnerable regions.

# #     **To conclude**, this project will not only make scientific contributions but also foster societal preparedness and resilience in addressing one of the most pressing environmental issues of the century.

# #     **What has been done so far and what gaps remain**:  
# #     - Researched different types of attributes needed for developing data models.
# #     - Explored various datasets to understand the structure, including year and rise in sea level.
# #     - Collected datasets and are working on curating them for further analysis.
# #     - **Major challenge**: Collecting datasets for different locations.

# #     **Who are affected**:
# #     - **People residing in low-lying coastal regions** face displacement and loss of property.
# #     - **Tourism, real estate, and fishing industries** may be affected by flooding and erosion, leading to significant losses.
# #     - **Cities with buildings, utilities, and roads along the shore** are at risk of flooding.

    collapsible_section("What are the primary causes of sea level rise?", """
    The primary causes of sea level rise linked to climate change are the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of ice from glaciers and polar regions. As global temperatures increase, seawater warms and expands, taking up more space, which contributes significantly to the rising levels observed in oceans worldwide. This phenomenon, known as thermal expansion, accounts for about half of the observed sea level rise in recent decades. Additionally, higher temperatures accelerate the melting of glaciers and ice sheets in polar regions like Greenland and Antarctica. When ice from these land-based sources melts, it flows into the ocean, directly increasing sea levels. This melting is particularly concerning because ice sheets hold vast amounts of water; even small increases in melt rates can lead to considerable changes in sea levels over time. Seasonal changes, particularly in the Arctic, have also shown that ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, affecting habitats and increasing the flow of freshwater into the sea. Rising sea levels have widespread impacts on coastal ecosystems, contributing to shoreline erosion, saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, and the loss of habitat for marine life. Combined, thermal expansion and ice melt present a complex challenge, as they not only contribute to rising waters but also indicate ongoing changes in Earthâ€™s climate systems. Addressing these root causes is essential to managing and potentially mitigating future sea level rise.
    """)

    collapsible_section("What are the effects of sea level rise?", """
    Sea level rise has a range of significant effects on both natural environments and human communities. Coastal erosion is one of the most visible impacts, as rising waters gradually wear away shorelines, threatening properties and natural habitats. Seawater intrusion is another serious concern, where saltwater encroaches into freshwater aquifers, jeopardizing drinking water supplies and agricultural lands. Habitat loss occurs as rising seas submerge coastal wetlands, mangroves, and estuaries, which serve as critical ecosystems for diverse marine and bird species. This environmental change disrupts ecosystems, leading to declines in biodiversity and impacting food chains.

    For communities near coastlines, rising sea levels can lead to forced relocation and displacement as homes, schools, and businesses are threatened or submerged. This creates significant social challenges, as entire communities may need to move, severing historical ties to land and culture. From an economic standpoint, sea level rise leads to increased costs for adapting infrastructure, such as building seawalls, improving drainage systems, and elevating structures. It also heightens the risk of major damage to roads, bridges, ports, and utilities during extreme weather events. In total, the economic and social burdens of sea level rise are vast, and addressing them requires proactive planning and adaptation to protect vulnerable populations and ecosystems.    """)

We also explored multiple datasets to understand their structures and find the most relevant data points, especially those capturing year-to-year trends in sea levels. As a team, we gathered valuable datasets, which we are now curating to ensure they are ready for analysis. This process has involved extensive filtering, cleaning, and standardizing, as the datasets came from diverse sources with varying levels of detail. A significant challenge we faced was in obtaining location-specific datasets, as sea level data differs across regions, making it essential to merge information from multiple sources while ensuring compatibility. Combining these datasets without losing critical information has been both complex and time-intensive. By working through these challenges together, we aim to build an accurate, comprehensive model that reflects global and regional trends in sea level rise.

        - Description: The average of the higher of the two daily high tides over a 19-year period.
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: Helps identify higher tidal ranges.

        **MHW (Mean High Water):**
        - Description: The average of all high water levels over a 19-year period.
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: Represents the average height of the high tides.

        **MSL (Mean Sea Level):**
        - Description: The average sea level based on observations over a period of time.
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: Often used as a reference point for various measurements, including vertical land movement and sea level rise.

        **MTL (Mean Tide Level):**
        - Description: The average of Mean High Water (MHW) and Mean Low Water (MLW).
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: Used as a midpoint between high and low tides.

        **MLW (Mean Low Water):**
        - Description: The average of all the low water levels recorded over a 19-year period.
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: Represents the typical low tide level.

        **MLLW (Mean Lower Low Water):**
        - Description: The average of the lower of the two daily low tides over a 19-year period.
        - Units: Feet (ft).
        - Use: A tidal datum that serves as a baseline for measuring water depth.

        **Lowest:**
        - Description: The lowest recorded water level during the given period.
        - Units: Feet (ft).

        **Inf:**
        - Description: This could represent flags for additional information about the data or indicate missing or extreme data points.
